        Mia started her business in 2017 by opening a shop in Hastings named <strong>Mia’s Boots</strong>.
        Mia’s Boots sells a curated selection of men’s and women’s boots.
        After a few years of successful business, Mia wants to expand her shop and brand
        so is opening another shop under the name <strong>Mia’s</strong> in a central Napier alleyway.
The new Mia’s store offers a wider range of boutique men’s, women’s, and children’s boots,
shoes, and sandals. Mia’s Boots continues to operate in Hastings with its unique curation of
boots. Mia doesn’t often do sales but offers some special promotions for charitable causes.
Mia would like a website for her stores so customers can appreciate the new Mia’s offerings
as well as the original Mia’s Boots. Mia would like the website to celebrate the new store
(while preserving the value of the original store) and explain the expansion of the business.
Customers should be able to browse the brands available in-store, and Mia would like to
complement that with “in-the-wild” photos of those shoe brands. Mia would also like
customers to be able to recommend new products that she should source and stock (as she
has the supplier relationships). It would be great if Mia could understand the demand for new
products before she decides to source them.
Mia hopes that the website will further establish Mia as the premier boutique shoe store
brand for the region, known for being really receptive to customers’ needs. Mia also simply
needs customers to know about her new store. Mia is conscious of her customers' personal
information and that the privacy of customers is respected.
